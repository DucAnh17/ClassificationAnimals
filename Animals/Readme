The data file used in the document includes 10075 images of 5 different animal species: cat, cow, dog, elephant, penguin. 
Each class has 1515 images used for training and 500 images used for validation.

**Model Architecture:**

- Use the pre-trained ResNet-50 model with weights from ImageNet, and exclude the final fully connected layer (`include_top=False`).
- Add a Dropout layer with a rate of 0.3 to mitigate overfitting.
- Add a Dense layer with the number of output classes equal to the number of labels, use the softmax activation function to predict the probability for each class.
- Keep the ResNet-50 layers trainable (`trainable=True`).

**Compile Model:**

- Use the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001.
- Use categorical_crossentropy loss function to train the model with labels that have been one-hot encoded.
- Evaluate the model based on accuracy.

**Callbacks:**

- EarlyStopping to halt training early if validation loss does not decrease after a certain number of epochs (5 epochs), and restore the best weights.
